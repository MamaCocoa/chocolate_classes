      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <h4>What should I wear to class?</h4>
        <p>Chocolate is messy so please do not wear your best or brand new clothing. Wear non-slip clean shoes and again, don't wear your best shoes as you may get chocolate on them. Wear something that you know will keep you warm or cool enough so you are comfortable.  The kitchen is kept at 68 degrees.  We will provide you with tape rollers, a chef's coat, hair and beard nets.  We also provide single-use, food-safe vinyl gloves and safety glasses when necessary.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <h4>Can I bring my children to class?</h4>
        <p>We have classes for students of every age and strongly encourage you to bring your children to perpetuate craft chocolate.  We love teaching children of any age and some classes are more pertinent than others. The children must be enrolled in a class with you (if under the age of 18) and we do not have a special waiting room or play room for anybody who is not signed up for a class.  This is a working professional kitchen regulated by the FDA and we have to maintain standards in order to keep our licensing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-content">
        <h4>Will I get chocolate at the end of the class?  How much chocolate will I eat in class?</h4>
        <p>You will be expected to taste and eat chocolates in class.  If you have allergies (to nuts, for instances) please mention that to the instructor.  We try to alert students of allergens on the premises and in the food.  Just to be on the safe-side we have kept nuts out of every class, except for the "Working with Nuts" class.  At the end of each class, the items produced by you will be packaged by you and taken home with you to do with as you see fit. We want you to have a pleasant and memmorable experience. We won't judge you.  It's chocolate.</p>  
      </div>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <h4>Can I have a private class?</h4>
        <p>Private classes are available.  We ask that you please allow us time to plan for them.  Classes are different than renting the space for an event.  Although we have staff to accommodate larger class sizes, we reserve the right to limit your private class, depending on the things you want to learn.  Safety comes first and absolutely dicates what we can and can't do.  Each of our instructors truly loves teaching and working with students so 
          let us know what you got in mind! </p>
